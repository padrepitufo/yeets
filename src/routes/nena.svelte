    <h3> Hero too?</h3>
    <p>
        I was hanging out with friends, and we were doing Karaoke. During 
        Karaoke, they picked a song called "Hero too" from the anime My Hero 
        Academia. It's a good anime, but the lyrics of the song playing were
        flawed. "...strength doesn't make a hero. True heroes stand up for
        what they believe." I agree that strength doesn't make a hero, but a 
        hero definitely needs it. They need physical, emotional, and mental 
        strength. I also think that heroes stand up for what they believe in, 
        but standing up for what you believe in doesn't mean you're a hero. 
        Adolf Hitler stood up for what he believed in; did that make him a 
        hero? No. He thought that Jews were the problem, and the only 
        solution was to exterminate them. I trust that the lyric writers had 
        good intentions when making this song, but someone could interpret 
        this severely wrong. Heroes stand up for the right thing, not what 
        they believe.
