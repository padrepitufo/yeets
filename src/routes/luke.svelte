    My thoughts about Minecraft.
Minecraft I would say it's fun because you have infinite possibilties.
You can create anything, Like cars, trains, houses, and boats.
and there is 4 gamemodes you can try! I will right them in a list.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Creative</li>
    <li>Survival</li>
    <li>Hardcore</li>
    <li>Adveture</li>
</ul>
<p>Now i will explain all the gamemodes, Creative has infinite possibilties to try.
    Survival is about surviving and trying not to die.
    But if you do you can always respawn! Hardcore is like survival
    but do not die! Because if you do you can not respawn.
    But you can spectate your world or delete it.
    Adventure is like all about adventuring.
    but you can't break blocks or place blocks. 
    So now I explained all the gamemodes. Also you can play servers on Minecraft.
    Like Hypixel, CubeCraft, ManaCube and many more. On the servers you can play with
    friends or family members. Theres also food in Minecraft like Cooked Steak, 
    Cooked Porkchop, Cooked Mutton, Cooked Rabbit, Cooked Salmon, Cooked Fish,
    Raw Beef, Raw Porkchop, Raw Mutton, Raw Rabbit, Raw Fish, Raw Salmon, Raw Chicken,
    Baked Potato, Apple, Chorus Fruit, Carrot, Melon Slice, Raw Potato, Beetroot,
    Cake, Rabbit Stew, Pumpkin Pie, Poisonous Potato, Mushroom Stew, Beetroot Stew,
    Golden Carrot, Bread, Cookie, Golden Apple, And the Enchanted Golden Apple.
    Now there is also 4 editions of minecraft first java edition the default edition
    then bedrock the realistic edition then pocket edition for phones and ipads
    then finally Education edition used by schools. Also you can add mods to Minecraft.
    Now I will add four reasons that Minecraft is a fun game to play in a list.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It's fun</li>
    <li>You can play with others</li>
    <li>You can have creativity</li>
    <li>You can really enjoy it!</li>
</ul>
